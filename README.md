## Background
Los Angeles faces a critical homelessness crisis characterized by a large unsheltered population. The complexity of this issue is compounded by factors such as mental health disorders, substance abuse, and lack of affordable housing. This project aims to provide actionable insights that can assist ACOF and other organizations in effectively addressing these challenges.

## Objectives
- Analyze ACOF survey data to identify health issues and demographic trends among homeless individuals.
- Evaluate the specific needs and interests of the homeless population regarding health services.
- Examine the state of homelessness among veterans in Los Angeles and across the U.S.
- Propose actionable solutions to mitigate homelessness in Los Angeles.

## Data Sources
1. **ACOF Survey Results**: Data collected from three ACOF properties:
   - California Hotel
   - Gower
   - Las Palomas
   - Total participants: 52 individuals.

2. **Demographic Statistics**: Data from Los Angeles County regarding the homeless population.

3. **National Homeless Veterans Data**: Statistics detailing homeless veterans across states from 2020 to 2023.

4. **Health Reports**: Various studies on health issues prevalent among homeless populations.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Utilized surveys to gather demographic information, health conditions, and lifestyle habits of participants from ACOF properties.
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted correlation analyses to identify relationships between health conditions and demographics, focusing on race/ethnicity.

3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapped the distribution of homeless populations and shelter availability in Los Angeles using Tableau.

4. **Literature Review**: Reviewed existing research on homelessness, health care access, and veteran services.

## Key Findings

### Health Correlations
- **Demographics**: 
  - Predominantly White/Caucasian (80% of diabetic participants).
  - High rates of other health conditions, including:
    - High blood pressure: 50%
    - Arthritis: 44%
    - High cholesterol: 32%

- **Health Implications**: The predominance of certain health issues in specific demographic groups highlights the need for targeted health interventions.

### Participant Interests
- **Interest in Services**: 
  - Participants showed varying levels of interest in accessing health-related treatments, with interest levels ranging from 40% to 50% in categories like:
    - Behavioral health
    - Dental services
    - Nutrition
    - Fitness
    - Substance abuse recovery
  - Lower interest was noted for medical care and substance abuse recovery, indicating areas where outreach efforts may need to be enhanced.

### Geographical Trends
- **Concentration of Homelessness**: 
  - High prevalence in areas like the Los Angeles Wholesale District, Venice, and North Hollywood.
  - Mapping revealed a direct correlation between areas of high homelessness and the need for low-income housing.

## Homeless Veterans Analysis
- **Trends**: California consistently ranks highest in homeless veterans, necessitating focused interventions.
  
- **Shelter Types**: 
  - Analysis of shelter types utilized indicates a significant need for:
    - Emergency shelters for immediate housing.
    - Transitional housing for long-term support addressing issues like unemployment and mental health.
    - Specialized services for veterans with severe mental health challenges.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Expand Low-Income Housing**: Increase the availability of affordable housing in high-need areas identified through geospatial analysis.

2. **Enhance Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services**: Develop tailored programs for common substance abuse issues, especially regarding methamphetamine and fentanyl.

3. **Increase Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing**: Provide immediate relief and support for the homeless population while they transition to permanent housing.

4. **Community Engagement and Policy Reform**: 
   - Foster collaboration among local government, nonprofits, and community stakeholders.
   - Advocate for policy changes that address the systemic issues contributing to homelessness.

## Conclusion
The homelessness crisis in Los Angeles requires a multifaceted approach. By focusing on housing, healthcare, community support, and policy reform, we can create meaningful solutions that address the root causes of homelessness and improve the lives of affected individuals.
